Litecore Library
=======

[![NPM Package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/bitcore-lib-grlc.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/bitcore-lib-grlc)

**A pure and powerful JavaScript Garlicoin library.**

## Principles

Garlicoin is a garlic-themed decentralized cryptocurrency, with an ASIC-mining resistant proof of work and rapid difficulty readjustment, intended to be mined on consumer-grade hardware. The decentralized nature of the Garlicoin network allows for highly resilient Garlicoin infrastructure, and the developer community needs reliable, open-source tools to implement Garlicoin apps and services.

## Get Started

```sh
npm install bitcore-lib-grlc
```

```sh
bower install bitcore-lib-grlc
```

## Documentation (bitcore, not grlc)

- Tests have not been modified for Garlicoin

The complete docs are hosted here: [bitcore documentation](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore). There's also a [bitcore API reference](https://github.com/bitpay/bitcore/blob/master/packages/bitcore-node/docs/api-documentation.md) available generated from the JSDocs of the project, where you'll find low-level details on each bitcore utility.

## Examples

- [Generate a random address](docs/examples.md#generate-a-random-address)
- [Generate a address from a SHA256 hash](docs/examples.md#generate-a-address-from-a-sha256-hash)
- [Import an address via WIF](docs/examples.md#import-an-address-via-wif)
- [Create a Transaction](docs/examples.md#create-a-transaction)
- [Sign a Bitcoin message](docs/examples.md#sign-a-bitcoin-message)
- [Verify a Bitcoin message](docs/examples.md#verify-a-bitcoin-message)
- [Create an OP RETURN transaction](docs/examples.md#create-an-op-return-transaction)
- [Create a P2SH address](docs/examples.md#create-a-p2sh-address)
- [Create a 2-of-3 multisig P2SH address](docs/examples.md#create-a-2-of-3-multisig-p2sh-address)
- [Spend from a 2-of-2 multisig P2SH address](docs/examples.md#spend-from-a-2-of-2-multisig-p2sh-address)

## Building the Browser Bundle

To build a bitcore-lib full bundle for the browser:

```sh
gulp browser
```

This will generate files named `bitcore-lib-grlc.js` and `bitcore-lib-grlc.min.js`.


## Development & Tests

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MaxPuig/bitcore-lib-grlc.git
cd bitcore-lib-grlc
npm install
```

Run all the tests:

```sh
gulp test
```

You can also run just the Node.js tests with `gulp test:node`, just the browser tests with `gulp test:browser` or create a test coverage report (you can open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` to visualize it) with `gulp coverage`.

## Security

We're using Bitcore in production, as are many others, but please use common sense when doing anything related to finances! We take no responsibility for your implementation decisions.
